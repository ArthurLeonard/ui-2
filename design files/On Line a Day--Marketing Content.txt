Years of Memories
One Line a Day is the app version of the popular one-line-a-day journal. Your daily entries are privately stored on your device (mobile version), or safely online if you use our web-based version. You can also choose to get regular reminders, so you’ll never forget to jot down something short and sweet from your day—a funny quote, crazy milestone, or even just what you ate for dinner.
